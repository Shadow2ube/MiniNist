# MiniNist

A (very) minimized version of the handwritten character database from [here](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19)
This contains the information of the alphanumerical system (0-9, A-Z, a-z)

Even though it is heavily shrunken, it still managed to contain 31000 characters

$$ (26 + 26 + 10) * 500 = 31000$$
